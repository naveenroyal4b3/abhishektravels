### 3. **Start Collecting Google Reviews** (CRITICAL)

   [Your Google Reviews Link]
   
   Your review helps us serve you better! 🙏
   ```

   Abhishek Travels
   +91 99123 25325
   Leave us a review: [Your Google Reviews Link]
   ```

**Target**: 
- Week 1: 10-15 reviews

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Respond to ALL reviews (positive and negative) within 24 hours
