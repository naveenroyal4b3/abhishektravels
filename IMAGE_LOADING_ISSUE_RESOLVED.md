## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem: Commit 1c11c35

Commit `1c11c35` ("Add comprehensive SEO, performance, and UX improvements") introduced several changes that **broke image loading**:

### 1. **`loading="lazy"` Attribute** ⚠️ MAIN CULPRIT
**What it did:**
- Added `loading="lazy"` to ALL images
- Browser deferred loading images until they were near the viewport
- Images didn't load immediately when page rendered

**Why it broke:**
- Combined with other factors, it prevented images from loading
- Browser's lazy loading implementation conflicted with custom code
- Images stayed in "pending" state and never loaded

**Fix:** Removed all `loading="lazy"` attributes

---

### 2. **`fetchpriority="low"` Attribute** ⚠️ SECONDARY ISSUE
**What it did:**
- Told browser to deprioritize image requests
- Browser treated images as low priority resources
- Images loaded very slowly or not at all

**Why it broke:**
- Browser deprioritized ALL image requests
- Network requests for images were delayed
- Images appeared broken or never loaded

**Fix:** Removed all `fetchpriority="low"` attributes

---

### 3. **Font Awesome Async Loading Trick**
**What it did:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="..." media="print" onload="this.media='all'">
```

**Why it broke:**
- Delayed Font Awesome CSS loading
- Icons didn't appear until JavaScript executed
- Could cause layout shifts and delays
- Potentially blocked rendering

**Fix:** Reverted to normal Font Awesome loading

---

### 4. **Redundant `initLazyLoading()` Function**
**What it did:**
- Custom IntersectionObserver implementation
- Attempted to handle lazy loading manually
- Ran alongside native `loading="lazy"`

**Why it broke:**
- Double lazy loading (native + custom)
- Conflicts between implementations
- Extra JavaScript overhead
- Could prevent images from loading

**Fix:** Removed the redundant function

---

## ✅ What We Fixed

### Changes Made:

1. ✅ **Removed ALL `loading="lazy"` attributes**
   - Images now load immediately
   - No lazy loading delays

2. ✅ **Removed ALL `fetchpriority="low"` attributes**
   - Images are no longer deprioritized
   - Browser treats images normally

3. ✅ **Fixed Font Awesome loading**
   - Removed async trick
   - Icons load immediately

4. ✅ **Removed `initLazyLoading()` function**
   - No conflicting implementations
   - Cleaner code

5. ✅ **Kept beneficial changes**
   - `decoding="async"` (helps performance)
   - DNS prefetch for CDNs (faster connections)
   - Error handling (`onerror` fallbacks)

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Broken - Commit 1c11c35):
```html
<img src="..." 
     loading="lazy"
     fetchpriority="low"
     decoding="async">
```
- ❌ Images didn't load
- ❌ Browser deprioritized images
- ❌ Lazy loading prevented immediate loading

### After (Fixed):
```html
<img src="..." 
     decoding="async">
```
- ✅ Images load immediately
- ✅ No deprioritization
- ✅ Normal browser behavior

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

**The main issue:** `loading="lazy"` combined with `fetchpriority="low"` told the browser:
1. "Don't load these images until they're near the viewport" (lazy loading)
2. "These images are low priority" (fetchpriority)

This combination prevented images from loading properly, especially on initial page load.

**The solution:** Remove both attributes and let images load normally, like they did before commit 1c11c35.

## 💡 Why Lazy Loading Failed Here

Lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`) is generally good for performance, BUT:

1. **It requires proper implementation** - Native lazy loading works, but conflicts can break it
2. **Combined with `fetchpriority="low"`** - Created a double penalty
3. **External CDN latency** - With lazy loading + low priority + slow CDN = images never load
4. **Browser behavior** - Some browsers handle lazy loading differently, especially with low priority

**Best practice:** Use lazy loading carefully, and never combine it with `fetchpriority="low"` on images you want to see.

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ Images load immediately
- ✅ No lazy loading delays
- ✅ No deprioritization
- ✅ Normal browser behavior
- ✅ Website works like before commit 1c11c35

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Lazy loading isn't always better** - Sometimes immediate loading is preferred
2. **Don't combine conflicting attributes** - `loading="lazy"` + `fetchpriority="low"` = broken
3. **Test after performance changes** - Performance "improvements" can break functionality
4. **Keep it simple** - Native browser behavior often works best

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Images loading properly!
